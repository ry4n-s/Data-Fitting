# Data Fitting

## Overview
This MATLAB program performs data fitting based on user input. It supports polynomial, exponential, and saturation models for fitting data loaded from a specified file.

## Features
- ðŸ“ˆ Supports three types of data fitting: Polynomial, Exponential, and Saturation.
- ðŸ“Š Automatically plots the raw data and the fitted curve.
- ðŸ§® Calculates the coefficient of determination (RÂ²) to assess the fit.

## Subfunctions Description
- `polynomial_fit`: Fits a polynomial of a given degree to the data and calculates RÂ².
- `exponential_fit`: Fits an exponential model to the data and calculates RÂ².
- `saturation_fit`: Fits a saturation model to the data and calculates RÂ².

## Plotting
The program generates a scatter plot of the raw data points and overlays the fitted curve. It also displays the fitting formula and the RÂ² value on the plot.
